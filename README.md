### Lawyers' Preferences of Documents Perceived as Authored by an LLM vs a Human

This repository contains the data (documents, survey) created for the following research paper:

Jakub Harasta, Tereza Novotna, and Jaromir Savelka. It Cannot Be Right If It Was Written by AI: On Lawyers' Preferences of Documents Perceived as Authored by an LLM vs a Human. _ArXiV_, 2024, available at https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2407.06798

## Outline

**NOTE: Documents and survey were distributed in Czech language. Documents/survey in Czech (prefix CZ in file name) are originals, documents/survey in English (prefix EN in file name) are translations prepared to mimic the Czech originals as closely as possible.**

We manually drafted two acknowledgements of debt - Verbose (Verbose.pdf) and Brief (Brief.pdf). No AI was used in support of the drafting process.

We assigned the participants into Group A and Group B.

Participants in Group A received Verbose document labelled as Human-crafted (GroupA_Verbose_Human.pdf) and Brief document as AI-generated (GroupA_Brief_AI.pdf).

Participants in Group B received the Verbose document labelled as AI-generated (GroupB_Verbose_AI.pdf) and Brief document as Human-crafted (GroupB_Brief_Human.pdf).

We asked the participants to evaluate the language quality and correctness of the documents. Additionally, we asked the participants on their opinion about future fully-automated drafting of legal documents. Both evaluation instructions and survey questions are available (Survey).
